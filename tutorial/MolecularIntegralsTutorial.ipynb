    "# Molecular Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to see how to implement the _McMurchie-Davidson scheme_ to compute molecular integrals over _Gaussian functions_ using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).  \n",
    "We are going to closely follow Chapter 9 of the book _Molecular Electronic Structure Theory_ by _T. Helgaker et al._, although the inspiritation for this work comes from [this post](http://joshuagoings.com/2017/04/28/integrals/) and thus credits go to the author of the latter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional quantum chemical calculations we are essentially interested in the evaluation of two classes of molecular integrals.  \n",
    "The first class consists of integrals over _one-electron operators_ $\\hat{O}(\\mathbf{r})$, such as in the case of overlap, kinetic energy and electron-nuclear Coulomb attraction integrals.  \n",
    "These integrals have the general form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the integrals are computed over a set of known functions $\\{\\chi_{\\mu}\\}$, which are usually chosen to be linear combinations of Gaussian functions.\n",
    "This choice is arbitrary (in principle any type of function can be used), but it is motivated on a firm theoretical ground and has proven to be a very successful strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of Guassian functions, each featuring (slightly) different properties.\n",
    "In order to efficientely evaluate the integrals and handle them in electronic structure calculations, we shall use the form of Gaussian which is most convenient at every step of the procedure.\n",

    "One therefore would preferably work with SGFs rather than CGFs so as to keep their number as small as possible. Nevertheless, contrary to SGFs, CGFs are separable in the three Cartesian components, a fact that substantailly facilitates the calculation of integrals.\n",
    "Therefore, the general approach is to evaluate molecular integrals over CGFs first, and then transform the integrals to the SGFs basis in order to decrease their total number.\n",
